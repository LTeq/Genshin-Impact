# Meta Analysis on Team Compositions v1.0

## Abstract: 

## *Background: Preface For How to Understand the Meta*
As a base game, Genshin Impact is about optimizing four different character to clear content efficiently and consistently. How these four team slots interact with one another is multi-faceted with each added character fundamentally changing how the overall cast rotates through abilities or optimizes stats. Each team member has a functional role to serve in that team and fundamentally alters how the others play. However, the defining characteristics of each of these signature roles often has loose terminology currently applied to it. Characters in the game often overlap within the current defintions of roles; hyper-carry, enabler-carry, turrets, sub-dps, sub-carry, healer, burst support, or support are among the most common. The overabundance of terminology and inability to confine characters within Genshin Impact within a bounded package is speaking to the diversity of the cast, however it also speaks to a lack of uniformity (or perhaps an inability) within the community to separate the important characteristics of a character from the irrelevant.

Team compositions consist of main damage dealer slot(s), core support slot(s), then flexible slot(s).
