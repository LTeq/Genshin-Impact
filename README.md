# Genshin-Impact
## LTeq#1978

This repository contains my meta analysis and guides on Genshin Impact. It is simply version content for any content I release. Material that I have not released publicly outside this repository is not final. I shall mark any **Header 1** sections I have in my files with a date which they were last updated on so that readers can evaluate what is up to date and what is not.

I generally do not value guides on weapons or stats due to their highly circumstantial nature. Instead, this repository contains guides on mechanical elements of Genshin Impact.

### Quality Control
OD = Outdated.
