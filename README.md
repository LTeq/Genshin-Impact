# Genshin-Impact
## LTeq#1978

This repository contains my meta analysis and guides on Genshin Impact. It is simply version content for any content I release. Material that I have not released publicly outside this repository is not final. I shall mark any **Header 1** sections I have in my files with a date which they were last updated on so that readers can evaluate what is up to date and what is not.

This repository highlights mechanics within Genshin Impact. It doesn't place emphasis on weapons or stat optimizations.

### Quality Control
OD = Outdated.
WIP = Work in Progress.
