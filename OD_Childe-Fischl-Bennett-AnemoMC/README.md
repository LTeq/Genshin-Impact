# Childe-Fischl-Bennet-AnemoMC
12-18-20

## Reasoning For OD Tag
This rotation is out of date (OD). Infusing hydro into Anemo MC's Q proved impractical for aiming for a 15-20 second rotation which is ideal, instead it became 25 seconds.
Future iterations shall infuse pyro into Anemo MC's Q as the extra 20% shred on hydro is not as impactful as being able to vape charge shots.

## Guideline on Rotation
This rotation followed a specific set of priorities in order of importance:
  * Align Bennett Q to Melee CD on Childe. *This priority shall be removed in future iterations.*
  * Vaporize Childe's Q with full buffs applied.
  * Full Uptime on Fischl's Oz.
  * Snapshot Fischl's Oz within Bennett Q.
  * Double Viridescent Venerer both Electro and Hydro.
  * Use Anemo MC Q while Childe's melee is off-cooldown.

Future iterations shall include the following priorities:
  * Snapshot Anemo MC Q within Bennett Q.
  * Consolidate all charge shots within periods of time where enemies are crowd-controlled by Anemo MC Q.
  * Rotation shall last 15-20 seconds.
