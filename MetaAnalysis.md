## *Preface For How to Understand the Meta*
Fundamentally, Genshin Impact is a game about optimizing four different character slots so that you can clear content efficiently and consistently. How these four team slots interact with one another is multi-faceted with each added character fundamentally changing how the team composition rotates through abilities or optimizes stats. Team comps generally consist of a main damage dealer, a core support structure, then two or three flexible slots.

The *main damage dealer* of a team composition sets an initial premise for designing the overall support structure. It defines the key questions that the composition wants to answer. Listed are ranked the most defining considerations. 
* Element
  * Disjointed versus continuous elemental application. 
  * Split damage typing.
  * Available supportive buffs or debuffs.
* 
  * Self-sufficiency.
  * 
The support structure is then built around fulfilling that premise
