## *Preface For How to Understand the Meta*
Fundamentally, Genshin Impact is a game about optimizing four different character slots so that you can clear content efficiently and consistently. How these four team slots interact with one another is multi-faceted with each added character fundamentally changing how the team composition rotates through abilities or optimizes stats. Team comps generally consist of a main damage dealer, a core support structure, then one or two flexible slots.

## *What Makes Each Character Unique*
### Main Damage Dealer
The *main damage dealer* of a team composition sets an initial premise for designing the overall support structure. It defines the key questions that the composition wants to answer. Listed are ranked the most important considerations.

  * Damage distribution between abilties. [Ning Guang]()
  * Disjointed versus continuous elemental application. [Ganyu and Childe]()
* **Energy Generation** 
  * Self-sufficiency. [Razor]()

The *support structure* of a team composition then enhances these subpoints and, from them, we can begin to flesh out the beginnings of our ability order, our rotation. Specifically, we can start to determine how much time we spend on our main damage dealer, our core support structure, or our flexible slot. Listed are the most important considerations.
