# Meta Analysis on Team Compositions v1.0
### *02-28-21*

## Abstract: 

## *Background: Preface For How to Understand the Meta*
As a base game, Genshin Impact is about optimizing four different character to clear content efficiently and consistently. How these four team slots interact with one another is multi-faceted with each added character fundamentally changing how the overall cast rotates through abilities or optimizes stats. Each team member has a functional role to serve in that team and fundamentally alters how the others play. However, the defining characteristics of each of these signature roles often has loose terminology currently applied to it. Characters in the game often overlap within the current defintions of roles; hyper-carry, enabler-carry, turrets, sub-dps, sub-carry, healer, burst support, or support are among the most common. The overabundance of terminology and inability to confine characters within Genshin Impact within a bounded package is speaking to the diversity of the cast, however it also speaks to a lack of uniformity (or perhaps an inability) within the community to separate the important characteristics of a character from the irrelevant.

Team compositions generally consist of a main damage dealer, a core support structure, then one or two flexible slots.

The current state of Genshin Impact has numerous comparisons being made between various characters in the game, namely the 5 star main damage dealers. It is immediately apparent some the differences between them, elemental type, damage potential, and access to amplifying reactions, . However, this is a meta analysis on how the uniqueness that each character within Genshin Impact can gradually shape the optimal way to utilize a character, referred to as a rotation. In fact, the immediately obvious factors that can be associated with a character are negligible to how they play in a repeating 15-25 second sequence.

Characteristics of a main damage dealer:

  * Damage distribution between abilties. [Case Study: Ning Guang]()
  * Disjointed versus continuous elemental application. [Case Study: Ganyu and Childe]()
  * Self-sufficiency. [Case Study: Razor]()
