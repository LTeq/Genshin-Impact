## Preface:

This is a document going over the conclusions I’ve drawn on places where Anemo MC is a viable option for a team composition. Key points I hit on in this document are:

Anemo MC’s Place in the Meta
Core Mechanics

## Meta:

Anemo MC should be viewed as a slot in for team cores that already hit synergistic points with Anemo MC. These synergistic points in order of importance include:

  * Short Q animation that allows a ranged main dps or fast animation E character to overlap damage for 6 seconds.
  * Ability to proc viridescent venerer with specific sub-dps characters within 1 swap cooldown using multi-hits on E.
  * 20% resistance shred to anemo as well as an infused element for 10-16 seconds.

## Core Mechanics:

### E Damage and Cooldown: 
Anemo MC has two E damages: weak and strong. Releasing before a strong tick will do weak damage and have a 5s cooldown, and releasing after a strong tick will do strong damage and have a 8s cooldown.
  * Weak Ticks: 0.35s, 0.5s
  * Strong Ticks: 0.85s, 1s, 1.35s, 1.5s
It is recommended to release either before or at 3 ticks to maximize damage. 
#### MV/s on T9 Hold E
  * Weak Cut: 20.40%
  * Infused Weak Cut: 5.10%
  * Strong Cut: 28.56%
  * Infused Strong Cut: 7.14%
  * Weak Blast: 299.20%
  * Infused Weak Blast: 74.80%
  * Strong Blast: 326.40%
  * Infused Strong Blast: 81.60%
There are only 2 swirl procs maximum: one on initial tick, then the second on release.

### Elemental Infusion Mechanics: 
Anemo MC’s E generally infuses on the second tick and prioritizes: 
 * Enemy Elemental Shields > Self > Enemy Element
Anemo MC’s Q generally infuses on the second or third tick and prioritizes: 
 * Enemy Elemental Shields > Self > Enemy Element

### Q and C6 Mechanics:
Anemo MC’s Q ticks 9 times over a 6 second period and swirls 5 times.
 * Resistance shred on anemo will occur after the first instance of anemo damage from Q.
 * Resistance shred on the infused element will occur after the first instance of elemental damage from Q.
The resistance shred will last 10 seconds since the last tick.

### Double Viridescent Venerer Synergies:
These strategies are the same for both E and Q. Note that Viridescent Venerer cannot proc while the anemo character wielding it is off-field.
