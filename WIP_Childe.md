# Childe
02-28-21

## Initial Talking Points
  * Switches between a discrete elemental application and a continuous elemental application. 
    * Discrete elemental application consists of charge shots applying two instances of hydro: one for the initial elemental reaction, then another for reapplying hydro for a second elemental reaction to occurr off off.
    * The continuous elemental application consists of hydro application that is difficult to override due to the simultaneous application of 2 * 1U of hydro.
  * Childe is optimal within a 15 second rotation, however variations in sub-dps may extend this to 20 seconds. 25 seconds rotation segments are not ideal.
    * *Note:* The exact definition of rotation segments are loosely defined. As more rotations are printed on this repository, the definition will be more strict.
    However, the running definition of a rotation segment is a punctuation in the means by which damage is dealt. For childe, this punctuation would likely end up being 
    switching from his discrete instance of damage to his continuous instance of damage. A 15 second rotation is chosen
