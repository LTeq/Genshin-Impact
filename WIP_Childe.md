# Childe
02-28-21

## Initial Talking Points
  * Switches between a discrete elemental application and a continuous elemental application. 
    * Discrete elemental application consists of charge shots applying two instances of hydro: one for the initial elemental reaction, then another for reapplying hydro for a second elemental reaction to occurr off off.
    * The continuous elemental application consists of hydro application that is difficult to override due to the simultaneous application of 2 * 1U of hydro.

### Potential Childe Meta Evolution
 * Childe ideally would want a 15 second rotation, however his current sub-dps pool usually extends an optimal rotation to be within the range of 20 seconds.
 * There is potential for childe to benefit from an Anemo sub-dps due to his synergy with the high-damaging Anemo MC Q or Venti Q. However, such a change will likely rewrite Childe's compositions rather than slot-in for them.
